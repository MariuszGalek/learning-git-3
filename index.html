            <h1>The Last Goodbye</h1>
            <h2>Billy Boyd</h2>
            <p>I saw the light fade from the sky<br>
                On the wind I heard a sigh<br>
                As the snowflakes cover my fallen brothers<br>
                I will say this last goodbye
            </p>
            <p>Night is now falling<br>
                So ends this day<br>
                The road is now calling<br>
                And I must away<br>
                Over hill and under tree<br>
                Through lands where never light has shone<br>
                By silver streams that run down to the sea
            </p>
	    <p> Under cloud, beneath the stars<br>
		Over snow one winter’s morn<br>
		I turn at last to paths that lead home<br>
		And though where the road then takes me<br>
		I cannot tell<br>
		We came all this way<br>
		But now comes the day<br>
		To bid you farewell<br>
		Many places I have been<br>
		Many sorrows I have seen<br>
		But I don’t regret<br>
		Nor will I forget<br>
		All who took the road with me
	    </p>
	    <p>Night is now falling<br>
		So ends this day<br>
		The road is now calling<br>
		And I must away<br>
		Over hill and under tree<br>
		Through lands where never light has shone<br>
		By silver streams that run down to the sea
