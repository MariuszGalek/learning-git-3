            <h1>The Last Goodbye</h1>
            <h2>Billy Boyd</h2>
            <p>I saw the light fade from the sky<br>
                On the wind I heard a sigh<br>
                As the snowflakes cover my fallen brothers<br>
                I will say this last goodbye
            </p>
            <p>Night is now falling<br>
                So ends this day<br>
                The road is now calling<br>
                And I must away<br>
                Over hill and under tree<br>
                Through lands where never light has shone<br>
                By silver streams that run down to the sea
            </p>
